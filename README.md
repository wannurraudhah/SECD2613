# SECD2613 - System Analysis and Design
  In this project, our team has created a prototype website that aims to develop an integrated task management system to streamline paper writing and publication processes for postgraduate students and lecturers. Currently, these tasks rely on inefficient and error-prone manual methods using tools like Excel, WhatsApp, and email. Our proposed system will centralize task management into a user-friendly platform, offering features such as task organization, dynamic scheduling, real-time collaboration, and automated progress tracking.

  This system will enhance productivity and efficiency, reduce dependency on multiple tools, and ensure the accuracy and integrity of academic work. With universal browser compatibility and a responsive design, users can access and manage their tasks from any location and device. Leveraging advanced web technologies, this project aims to deliver a scalable, reliable, and secure solution, ultimately improving the quality of academic research and publication.
